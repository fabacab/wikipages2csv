Script to extract data from an Apple WikiServer's data store by querying the
filesystem itself. Creates a 'wikipages.csv' file that's readable by any
spreadsheeting application, such as Numbers.app or Microsoft Excel.app.

USAGE:   To use this script, change to the WikiServer's pages directory, then
         just run this script. A file named wikipages.csv will be created in
         your current directory. For instance:

             cd /Library/Collaboration/Groups/mygroup/wiki  # dir to work in
             wikipages2csv.sh                               # run the script
             cp wikipages.csv ~/Desktop                     # save output

WARNING: Since the WikiServer's files are only accessible as root, this script
         must be run as root to function. Additionally, this is not extremely
         well tested, so use at your own risk.
